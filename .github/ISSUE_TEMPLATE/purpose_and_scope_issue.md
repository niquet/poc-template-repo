## Business Need or Learning Outcome

Briefly describe what problem you are solving or what concept you are exploring.

## Success Criteria

How will we know this is successful? List clear, measurable outcomes or learning objectives.

## Out of Scope

Constrain the scope: What will NOT be included? List features, tasks, or areas intentionally excluded from this effort.

_Remember: Avoid adding features or abstractions that aren’t necessary._
