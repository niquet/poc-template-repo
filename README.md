Proof of concept and toy code should be unapologetically simple. Validate ideas quickly and to foster understanding. When you're exploring or trying to understand a problem space, complexity becomes your enemy:

- **Faster iteration:** Simple code means you can modify, test, and pivot rapidly
- **Clearer insights:** With fewer moving parts, you can actually see what's working and what isn't
- **Easier debugging:** When something breaks (and it will), you can fix it in minutes rather than hours

## No abstractions, No nonsense

For PoCs and toy code, this mindset is important:

- **Skip the design patterns** - just make it work
- **Hardcode values** instead of building configuration systems
- **Copy-paste code** rather than creating reusable functions
- **Use the most straightforward approach**, even if it's not "elegant"

## When complexity creeps in

If you start adding abstractions to your PoC "just in case," you're:

- Solving problems you don't have yet
- Making it harder to understand what you're actually testing
- Potentially obscuring the core insight you're trying to validate

_Save the engineering excellence for when you know the idea is worth building properly._
